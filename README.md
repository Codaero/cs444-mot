# SORT Implementation

## Abstract
This repository is an implementation of the SORT object tracking model which utilizes a Yolo Model, Kalman Filter, and Hungarian Algorithms to perform object tracking and assignment with predicated/measured filtering. An output of our tracking model is shown in the link below, and our final report is linked in the file named CS444__SORT.pdf.

## Instructions 

⚠️ DISCLAIMER: CUDA IS NECESSARY TO RUN THIS REPOSITORY ⚠️

The first step is to clone the repository and modify test.py file_path variable with a new filepath to a video file (.mp4, .mov, etc.). After modifying the file, run:
```
python3 test.py
```
