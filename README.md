# SORT Implementation

## Abstract
This repository is an implementation of the SORT object tracking model which utilizes a Yolo Model, Kalman Filter, and Hungarian Algorithms to perform object tracking and assignment with predicated/measured filtering. An output of our tracking model is shown in the link below, and our final report is linked in the file named CS444__SORT.pdf.
